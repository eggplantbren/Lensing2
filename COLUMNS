The columns of sample.txt and posterior_sample.txt are as follows. They are
given in the C++/Python array convention, i.e. the first column is column ZERO.

Column 0: sigma0, the constant noise standard deviation
Column 1: sigma1, the coefficient for the part of the noise that scales with
the brightness of the image. The overall noise standard deviation is
sqrt(sigma_from_file^2 + sigma0^2 + sigma1*(mock image)).

Columns 2-9: The NIE parameters b (circularized), q, core radius,
xc, yc, theta, shear, theta_shear

Column 10: Dimensionality of lens blobs (constant, 4)

Column 11: Maximum number of lens blobs (10)

Columns 12-16: xc, yc, width, mu (brightness), mu (width)
	hyperparameters for distribution of lens blobs

Column 17: Number of lens blobs

Columns 18-27: x positions of the lens blobs (padded with zeros)

Columns 28-37: y positions of the lens blobs (padded with zeros)

Columns 38:47: masses of the lens blobs (padded with zeros)
