The columns of sample.txt and posterior_sample.txt are as follows. They are
given in the C++/Python array convention, i.e. the first column is column ZERO.

Column 0: sigma0, the constant noise standard deviation
Column 1: sigma1, the coefficient for the part of the noise that scales with
the brightness of the image. The overall noise standard deviation is
sqrt(sigma_from_file^2 + sigma0^2 + sigma1*(mock image)).

Columns 2-9: The NIE parameters b (circularized), q, core radius,
xc, yc, theta, shear, theta_shear
