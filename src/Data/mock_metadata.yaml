dimensions:

    nj: 100         # Number of pixels in the horizontal direction

    # Coordinates of image boundaries in units of your choice

    x_max: 8.0      # x-coordinate of right boundary

    y_max: 8.0      # y-coordinate of top boundary

psf:

    # If true, the PSF is applied on the
    # finer/subsampled grid. If false, the PSF is

computation:
    nrays: 1        # Rays per pixel per dimension. More than 1 or 2 gets expensive...
